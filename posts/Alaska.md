# Alaska

Alaska is a state located in the Western United States on the northwest extremity of North America. A semi-exclave of the U.S., it borders the Canadian province of British Columbia and the Yukon territory to the east; it also shares a maritime border with the Russian Federation's Chukotka Autonomous Okrug to the west, just across the Bering Strait. To the north are the Chukchi and Beaufort seas of the Arctic Ocean, while the Pacific Ocean lies to the south and southwest.

- Because of the expense and logistical difficulty of maintaining this distant possession
- Russia sale it to U.S. in 1867 for US\$7.2 million (equivalent to \$140 million in 2021), or approximately two cents per acre (\$4.74/ $km^2$).
- It was admitted as the 49th state of the U.S. on January 3, 1959.

## Transportation
- Alaska has few road connections compared to the rest of the U.S.
- Many cities, towns and villages in the state do not have road or highway access; the only modes of access involve travel by air, river, or the sea.
- Cities not served by road, sea, or river can be reached only by air, foot, dogsled, or snowmachine.
- Best: snowmachine
